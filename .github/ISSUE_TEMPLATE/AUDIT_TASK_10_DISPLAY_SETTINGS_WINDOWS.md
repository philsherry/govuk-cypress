Test the service with various native settings on a Windows computer.

### Tasks

Navigate the service using High Contrast Mode in Windows 10, to ensure nothing relies on colour alone and that no content vanishes or becomes unusable (such as buttons).

#### Accessibility Options

Test these as a minimum:

- [ ] Increase font size 200% (in browser)
- [ ] High contrast mode
- [ ] Invert colours
- [ ] Greyscale
