# Simone: dyslexic user

> ***“My spelling’s bad and forms take me ages to fill in, but I have to get things right in my job and the software I use helps me a lot.”***

Simone is 41 and lives with her husband and their 2 sons in Brentford. She works as an office manager for Brentford council, and likes walking her dog in her spare time.

She was diagnosed with dyslexia 2 years ago. She doesn’t mind people knowing she’s dyslexic, but she doesn’t really talk about it.

## Devices and technology

Simone uses specialist dyslexia software which reads out documents and web pages for her, and helps her read and spell.

The software helps her feel more confident about her writing, but she still asks a colleague to check important emails she’s sending, just in case. The colour highlighting feature helps her mark the important bits when there’s a lot of writing.

She uses a smartphone to make calls, and a tablet for audiobooks and checking social media. She occasionally buys things online.

## Goals and wishes

Simone wants to feel more confident using technology - she finds it difficult to learn anything new, and she doesn’t like asking for help (although her family and work colleagues are always supportive).

She makes crochet toys for children and would like to sell them online, but she doesn’t know where to start.

## Frustrations

### Difficulties with writing

It takes Simone a while to fill in forms, and sometimes she has to ask her husband or older son to check what she has written.

Her spelling is bad, and she relies on things like search engines to offer her suggestions as to what she meant.

### When content isn’t plain and simple

She finds it hard to concentrate when there are things moving on a page like banners or tickers.

Simone struggles when there’s a lot of writing to read, or when the language is complicated. She uses audiobooks when she can.

## Statistics about dyslexia

6.3 million people (around 10% of the UK population) have dyslexia.

1 in 6 adults has the reading level of an 11-year-old.

People with dyslexia often have other conditions, including dyscalculia (difficulties with numbers), ADD (attention deficit disorder) and ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder).
