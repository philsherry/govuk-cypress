# Claudia: partially sighted screen magnifier user

> ***“My screen magnifier has made it possible for me to use the web again. I just wish more companies kept their websites simple.”***

Claudia is 54 and lives in Huddersfield with her husband Len and daughter Dana who is 12. Her other two children are away at university.

Claudia is partially sighted due to glaucoma and diabetes.

She works part time as a social worker with Kirklees Council. She used to visit people in their homes, but lost her confidence as her sight got worse. Now she’s based in the office, and she’s hoping to start training and mentoring new social workers.

## Devices and technology

Claudia’s setup at work includes ZoomText (software that lets you magnify what’s on screen), a large monitor and a high visibility keyboard. She has a similar setup at home.

She recently got a Kindle Fire for reading - she has tried its screen reader function, but she prefers to use the magnification to read herself or use audiobooks.

Claudia prefers phone calls to emails and never sends text messages. She uses the ‘speech to text’ feature on her smartphone, which records a message and sends it to the person she’s contacting.

## Goals and wishes

Claudia wants to be able to phone any company she needs to contact - it’s so much quicker and easier for her to call than to write.

She also wishes there was less clutter on some websites - she just wants to get on with what she’s doing.

## Frustrations

Claudia tends to forget to scroll horizontally when she’s using ZoomText. When she’s filling in a form, she sometimes misses fields or help text when they’re next to each other (rather than above and below each other).

She hates it when she’s using ZoomText and a pop-up box appears off screen. She then needs to scroll to find and close the pop-up.

It’s confusing if the layout of a form isn’t consistent - for example, if she’s been magnifying a certain part of the screen to complete a form, but then that part is blank on the next page.

Sometimes it’s hard for Claudia to see web content clearly when she borrows her husband’s tablet, if the colour contrast isn’t good.

## Statistics about sight loss

About 2 million people in the UK have sight loss, and this figure is expected to double by 2050.

Individuals from black and Asian populations have a higher risk of diabetic eye disease and sight loss than white populations.

Less than one-third of people who were registered blind or partially sighted were offered training to help them get around in the year after they were registered.
