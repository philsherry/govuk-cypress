# Ron: older user with multiple conditions

> ***“I don’t like having to ring call centres - it’s too noisy and people don’t speak clearly enough.”***

Ron is 82 and lives in Swansea with his wife Barbara.

Ron’s been retired since he was 72. He has arthritis and is losing his hearing. He also has cataracts (though he’s had one removed) and has had both hips replaced.

He struggles most with background noise when he’s out with friends, and with the mouse when he’s using the computer.

## Devices and technology

Ron has a landline phone with a built-in loop, amplification and larger buttons. He also uses a Doro 6520 mobile phone. The buttons are big enough for him to press, but he refuses to text and doesn’t read messages.

He has a tablet his children gave him as a present, mainly to use video chat and email to stay in touch with his family.

Ron wears a hearing aid in each ear. He’s disappointed that they mainly make things louder (not clearer), but they’re useful when he switches them to a hearing loop, like at his local train station.

## Goals and wishes

Ron wishes websites used clearer colours.

He also wishes more websites showed phone numbers he could ring.

## Frustrations

If Ron’s having a formal appointment with someone, it’s hard for him to hear if there’s no hearing loop or it doesn’t work well.

He finds it stressful calling a contact centre - there’s often a lot of background noise, and he struggles when the person he’s talking to doesn’t speak clearly.

Ron’s poor eyesight makes it hard for him to read large blocks of text. He doesn’t know how to adjust his browser settings, and often he’ll just give up.
