# Saleem: profoundly deaf user

> ***“I’m fluent in British Sign Language, but people don’t realise it’s different from English and things can be difficult for me to understand.”***

Saleem is 22 years old and lives with his family in Blackburn. He’s profoundly deaf and is fluent in British Sign Language (BSL).

He’s currently unemployed, and plans to get some more training at college to help him find a job. He started a catering course last year but the interpreter they provided wasn’t fully qualified and didn’t have much experience. Saleem got behind and gave up.

He isn’t very confident about learning new things. He struggles with English because of the differences with BSL in grammar and vocabulary.

## Devices and technology

Saleem has an Android tablet, and loves being able to sign to his friends on video chat. He’s sharing his family’s laptop until he can afford his own.

He also has an iPhone 5 that his brother gave him. He’s tried using it for video chat but it’s harder to see what people are saying as the screen’s quite small.

## Goals and wishes

Saleem wants more people to know British Sign Language (BSL). His brother signs well and his parents know a bit, but they’re the only ones in his family who do.

He’d like captions (subtitles) to make sense - sometimes they’re rubbish and you don’t know what they mean.

## Frustrations

### When content doesn’t work well for him

It’s annoying for Saleem when captions just say things like ‘music playing’ and don’t have the song words. It’s also better when they have different colours to show who’s speaking.

If there are no captions, transcripts are ok instead - but Saleem finds it difficult to read large blocks of text.

Because his English isn’t great, if something isn’t easy to understand, he needs it in BSL. He also needs search engines to correct his spelling.

### When there’s no alternative for deaf people

Saleem hates it when his mum has to make phone calls for him. He can’t use a phone and his minicom broke, so he has to be able to contact people by email, chat or text.

He can’t use intercoms - he has to say “I’m deaf, I can’t hear you”, and he usually just follows someone else through the door.

Saleem usually has to enter his mobile number when he’s filling in a form, but there’s no space for him to say he prefers to get text messages to calls.
