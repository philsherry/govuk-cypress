# Christopher: user with rheumatoid arthritis

> ***“I’m training my software to understand my voice commands. In the meantime, I’ll carry on using a keyboard to get around websites as it’s less painful than a mouse.”***

Christopher is 53 and lives with his wife Helen in Manchester. They’ve just become grandparents for the first time.

Christopher works as management accountant for a local food manufacturing company. He’s been working there for 22 years.

He developed rheumatoid arthritis 10 years ago. His company assesses his workspace every year and make sure he has what he needs.

## Devices and technology

Christopher uses a desktop computer at work and a keyboard with a wrist rest. He has programmed some shortcuts into his keyboard, and prefers those to his trackball mouse (which is painful to use after a while).

He has just tried out Dragon NaturallySpeaking (speech recognition software). He thinks it may work well for him, and he’s going to invest more time in ‘training’ it to understand his voice.

He has a basic mobile phone for calls. He thinks there’s no point in him getting a smartphone that he can’t use.

## Goals and wishes

Christopher wants more software to work properly with just the keyboard. He’s been trying to find some a way to make a calendar with baby pictures, but all the sites he’s tried only work with a mouse.

When he’s fully proficient in Dragon NaturallySpeaking, he wants to be able to use any website at all.

## Frustrations

It’s annoying for Christopher when he can’t use certain parts of a website with a keyboard, like video players and navigation menus.

It takes him a while to fill out forms, and he hates it when they time out without much warning.

He wastes a lot of time trying to tab through things like navigation menus. He’d love to have fewer things to tab through in general.

He sometimes has problems with pop-up boxes. This happens most when a pop-up appears but the tab control stays on the background page, meaning he can’t interact with the pop-up or close it.

## Statistics about disability

Almost 1 in 5 people (around 19% of the population) in the UK have a disability. The likelihood of having a disability increases the older you get.

Nearly 700,000 people in the UK have rheumatoid arthritis.

There are nearly 7 million people with disabilities who are of working age - nearly 19% of the working population.
